Medical Image Motion Simulation Pipeline. Able to apply simulated translational and rotational motion to DICOM and NIFTI images. Motion can be applied on individual slices or entire volume, and intensity of motion can be changed.

Options to perform volume-to-volume or slice-to-volume registration using existing registration algorithm (SLIMM) and another option to plot said motion registration parameters output by SLIMM
